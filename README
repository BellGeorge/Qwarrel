4. Here the Qwarrel app  basically  the information is organized  as the Categories like Books, Movies , Creativity & innovative ideas â€¦.

5 . Under these Categories an User can create a topic/view the topics. Here the topic acts as a discussion thread for user to discuss that is by means of posting comments,

6. But for posting the comments an User should be logged in using Facebook User id. 

7. I have used Facebook integration api to communicate from SFDC and Facebook.

8. And also there is a separate Facebook app is created in Facebook called Qwarrel, 

9. This app does not require the SFDC user id and this app is used for community for sharing the information across sales user/Customers/Contacts/Accounts in SFDC who has Facebook User id.
